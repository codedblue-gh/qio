        A website redesign can be a crucial step for businesses and
        organizations looking to enhance their online presence. Here are several
        compelling reasons why you might need a website redesign:

      <ul class="advantages__list">
        <li class="advantages__item item-advantages">
          <div class="item-advantages__inner">
            <span
              data-scramble-text="Outdated Design"
              class="item-advantages__title"
              >Outdated Design</span
            >
            <p class="item-advantages__text">
              Design trends evolve, and an outdated website can make your brand
              appear unprofessional or out of touch. A fresh, modern design can
              enhance your brand image and attract more visitors.

        <li class="advantages__item item-advantages">
          <div class="item-advantages__inner">
            <span
              data-scramble-text="Poor User Experience (UX)"
              class="item-advantages__title"
              >Poor User Experience (UX)</span
            >
            <p class="item-advantages__text">
              If users struggle to find information or navigate your site, they
              are likely to leave. A redesign can improve usability, making it
              easier for visitors to engage with your content.

        <li class="advantages__item item-advantages">
          <div class="item-advantages__inner">
            <span
              data-scramble-text="Changing Business Goals"
              class="item-advantages__title"
              >Changing Business Goals</span
            >
            <p class="item-advantages__text">
              As your business grows or pivots, your website should reflect
              these changes. A redesign can help align your online presence with
              your current goals, services, or products.

        <li class="advantages__item item-advantages">
          <div class="item-advantages__inner">
            <span
              data-scramble-text="SEO Improvements"
              class="item-advantages__title"
              >SEO Improvements</span
            >
            <p class="item-advantages__text">
              An outdated site may not be optimized for search engines,
              affecting your visibility online. A redesign provides an
              opportunity to implement SEO best practices, improving rankings
              and attracting organic traffic.
